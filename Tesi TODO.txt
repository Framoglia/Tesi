Starting from the file the Bastien will give me i define the high voltage node and possible connection and i optimize the layout defining the powerflow eq and the conductors set. I minimize the cost defined as discounted investment plus losses.

I actually started replicating the opt that Manon did.

The opt of manon is working, I could apply it to a bigger case, I want to implement it in the Campus grids
I have to retrieve the bus info and loads from the file.

What do i consider as substation in the campus grid.
How do i take into consideration the different voltage levels?

I basically have to define a new framework where substation can be arbitrarily placed?
This would mean having a very big opt problem?

So I have the highest voltage source

I have to connect it to a substation with a cable of said voltage.

From this substation i start a network connecting each voltage_1 level bus

then i have to identify the substation for voltage_2 level and optimizing the respective network
