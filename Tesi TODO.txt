Starting from the file the Bastien will give me i define the high voltage node and possible connection and i optimize the layout defining the powerflow eq and the conductors set. I minimize the cost defined as discounted investment plus losses.

I actually started replicating the opt that Manon did.

The opt of manon is working, I could apply it to a bigger case, I want to implement it in the Campus grids
I have to retrieve the bus info and loads from the file.

What do i consider as substation in the campus grid.
How do i take into consideration the different voltage levels?

I basically have to define a new framework where substation can be arbitrarily placed?
This would mean having a very big opt problem?

So I have the highest voltage source

I have to connect it to a substation with a cable of said voltage.

From this substation i start a network connecting each voltage_1 level bus

then i have to identify the substation for voltage_2 level and optimizing the respective network

I've made a modification to V2 called V2.2 where i can iterate over the campuses thanks to main.py
Some campuses run fine while other dont. WHY?? Moreover some do weir shit

Then I've made my test map with HV / MV / LV subs. The data side of it is ok (LBUS, SUBS, LINES) but now the algorithm must be modified. 
I cannot have every bus as slack, only the HV SUBS are slack while the MV and LV must be more similar to buses with P and Q = 0 
Does the voltage must be calculated and not imposed to 1??
